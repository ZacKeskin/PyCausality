    ## Technically also needs Matplotlib for the plot_pdf() function, however pip chooses
    #  to install its own pip which is a nightmare on OSX. Safer to let the users
    # manage their own matplotlib installation, since this is a pretty standard package and
    # plot_pdf() is in any case only an auxiliary function
