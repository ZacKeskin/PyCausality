"""
    This example demonstrates how to plot 3D density distributions of your time series data using PyCausality. We find
    this is a useful exploratory technique for quickly identifying possible bivariate relationships, and predicting
    the effectiveness of estimation techniques over the data. This is epecially true for considering manual
    parameter selection, as the results from different bandwidths etc. can quickly be assessed.

    Note that the functionality is currently limited to plotting bivariate relationships, i.e. 2D histograms with a z-xis projection.

    Also note that the z-axis represents probability - NOT probability density. For equal-sized bins, the visual
    effect is the same, but if variable-width bins are provided then the VOLUME of each bin's 3D projection does not
    reflect the probabilty of falling within the bin; it remains the HEIGHT of the bin which shows this.

    This efect is clearly seen when using AutoBins().equiprobable_bins.
